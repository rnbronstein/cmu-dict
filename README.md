# CMU-Dict

A simple Ruby application (soon to be API!) that parses the Carnegie Mellon University Pronunciation Dictionary to count syllables and find rhymes.

This repository includes the raw CMU dictionary text file along with a 130,000+ line database indexing each entry and breaking them down by words, phonemes, syllable count, and final syllable.

##TO-DO:
* Turn into Rails API
* Merge duplicate handling
* Finish Haiku parsing
* Integrate other NLTK corpora
