# poem-helper

A simple Ruby application (soon to be gem!) that parses the Carnegie Mellon University Pronunciation Dictionary to count syllables and find rhymes.

This repository includes the raw CMU dictionary text file along with a 130,000+ line database indexing each entry and breaking them down by words, phonemes, syllable count, and final syllable.

##TO-DO:
* Index on last syllable
* Turn into gem
